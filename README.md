# MultiTranslate

A Kotlin library for translating using multiple providers.

MultiTranslate currently* supports:
    
- LibreTranslate
- DeepL Translate

### Usage

Currently, MultiTranslate is not functional, like most of my projects.
However, here's what is planned.

- Easily translate text through a single function.
- Use languages from multiple providers.

### FAQ

- Why don't you test your code?
    - Because testing is for nerds.
    - I'm totally not just too lazy.
- oh my gosh this code is horrendous
    - deal with it


*When the first stable release is available.
